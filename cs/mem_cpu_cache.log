## Associativity
* trade-off
a) Checking more places takes more power and chip area,
b) and potentially more time. On the other hand, caches with more associativity suffer fewer misses
fully associative - the best miss rates, but practical only for a small number of entries
N-way set associative cache: 8 is a common choice for later implementations
direct-mapped cache - if two locations map to the same entry, they may continually knock each other out. anti-fragmantion worsens this case.

## Write policies
[background on ioremap, cacheing, cache coherency on x86](https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/4/29/480)
• write-through cache implementation;
• write-back cache implementation.
• write-combining; and
• uncacheable.

    [PATCH] change_page_attr and AGP update
+ * Change the page attributes of an page in the linear mapping.
+ * This should be used when a page is mapped with a different caching policy
+ * than write-back somewhere - some CPUs do not like it when mappings with
+ * different caching policies exist. This changes the page attributes of the
+ * in kernel linear mapping too.

Why is transposing a matrix of 512x512 much slower than transposing a matrix of 513x513?
