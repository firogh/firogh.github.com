    [PATCH] Writeback page range hint
    Modify mpage_writepages to optionally only write back dirty pages within a
    specified range in a file (as in the case of O_SYNC).  Cheat a little to avoid
    changes to prototypes of aops - just put the <start, end> hint into the
    writeback_control struct instead.  If <start, end> are not set, then default
    to writing back all the mapping's dirty pages.

    [PATCH] page writeback locking update
+ * If a page is already under I/O, generic_writeback_mapping() skips it, even
+ * if it's dirty.  This is desirable behaviour for memory-cleaning writeback,
+ * but it is INCORRECT for data-integrity system calls such as fsync().  fsync()
+ * and msync() need to guarentee that all the data which was dirty at the time
+ * the call was made get new I/O started against them.  The way to do this is
+ * to run filemap_fdatawait() before calling filemap_fdatawrite().
