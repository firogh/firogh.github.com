# Process
有点类似于software tool, programming需要自己把一些抽象概念, 变成自己的小工具.通过使用这些小工具来解决问题.
他们不是别的什么东西, 而是必要的for problem solving.
我先验的确定CS的主题是 computational process.

完备: 真的都能证明但computation本身不是万能的.

model of computation: Hypercomputation
µ-Recursive Functions
Every model of computation has a change space/set of computational objects, it's the memory or pripheral.
We use different signifiers in different layer/space/scope to refer the change space.
Variable/name space, VM space, Physical memory space.
# Naming is summon
A procedure is a pattern for the local evolution of a computational process
Making statements about the overall, or global, behavior of a process 
whose local evolution has been specified by a procedure is 
very difficult to do in general, but we can at least
try to describe some typical patterns of process evolution..

Linear recursion and iteration
This type of process, characterized by a chain of deferred operations, is called a recursive process .
Carrying out this process requires that the interpreter keep track of the
operations to be performed later on.

iterative process is one whose state can be sum-
marized by a fixed number of state variables , together with a fixed rule
that describes how the state variables should be updated as the process
moves from state to state and an (optional) end test that specifies con-
ditions under which the process should terminate.
function 本身不是运算的参数;

When we describe a procedure as recursive, we are referring
to the syntactic fact that the procedure definition refers (either directly
or indirectly) to the procedure itself.

It may seem disturbing that we refer to a recursive procedure
such as fact-iter as generating an iterative process. However, the pro-
cess really is iterative: Its state is captured completely by its three state
variables, and an interpreter need keep track of only three variables in
order to execute the process.



Our traffic with the subject matter of this book involves us with
three foci of phenomena: the human mind, collections of computer 
programs, and the computer.

A finite automaton is a mathematical machine for determining whether a string
is contained within some language.
