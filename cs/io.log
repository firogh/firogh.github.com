    sched: Provide iowait counters
    For counting how long an application has been waiting for
    (disk) IO, there currently is only the HZ sample driven
    information available, while for all other counters in this
    class, a high resolution version is available via
    CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS.
    In order to make an improved bootchart tool possible, we also
    need a higher resolution version of the iowait time.
    This patch below adds this scheduler statistic to the kernel.
