    [PATCH] mutex subsystem, core

# Mutex and semaphore
[Since regular semaphores are almost much extinct in the kernel (most users now rely on mutexes or rwsems)](https://lwn.net/Articles/600111/)

# Priority inversion and inheritance
[Linus on priority inheritance](https://yarchive.net/comp/linux/priority_inheritance.html)

# simple mutex
[MUTEX: Introduce simple mutex implementation](https://lwn.net/Articles/163807/)
Seems lost in competetion with Ingo's generic mutex.
