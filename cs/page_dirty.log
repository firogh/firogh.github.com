    VM: Fix nasty and subtle race in shared mmap'ed page writeback
    The VM layer (on the face of it, fairly reasonably) expected that when
    it does a ->writepage() call to the filesystem, it would write out the
    full page at that point in time.  Especially since it had earlier marked
    the whole page dirty with "set_page_dirty()".
    But that isn't actually the case: ->writepage() does not actually write
    a page, it writes the parts of the page that have been explicitly marked
    dirty before, *and* that had not got written out for other reasons since
    the last time we told it they were dirty.

    [PATCH] mm: tracking shared dirty pages
    Tracking of dirty pages in shared writeable mmap()s.
    The idea is simple: write protect clean shared writeable pages, catch the
    write-fault, make writeable and set dirty.  On page write-back clean all the
    PTE dirty bits and write protect them once again.
    The implementation is a tad harder, mainly because the default
    backing_dev_info capabilities were too loosely maintained.  Hence it is not
    enough to test the backing_dev_info for cap_account_dirty.
    The current heuristic is as follows, a VMA is eligible when:
     - its shared writeable
        (vm_flags & (VM_WRITE|VM_SHARED)) == (VM_WRITE|VM_SHARED)
     - it is not a 'special' mapping
        (vm_flags & (VM_PFNMAP|VM_INSERTPAGE)) == 0
     - the backing_dev_info is cap_account_dirty
        mapping_cap_account_dirty(vma->vm_file->f_mapping)
     - f_op->mmap() didn't change the default page protection

    [PATCH] Writeback page range hint
    Modify mpage_writepages to optionally only write back dirty pages within a
    specified range in a file (as in the case of O_SYNC).  Cheat a little to avoid
    changes to prototypes of aops - just put the <start, end> hint into the
    writeback_control struct instead.  If <start, end> are not set, then default
    to writing back all the mapping's dirty pages.

    [PATCH] page writeback locking update
+ * If a page is already under I/O, generic_writeback_mapping() skips it, even
+ * if it's dirty.  This is desirable behaviour for memory-cleaning writeback,
+ * but it is INCORRECT for data-integrity system calls such as fsync().  fsync()
+ * and msync() need to guarentee that all the data which was dirty at the time
+ * the call was made get new I/O started against them.  The way to do this is
+ * to run filemap_fdatawait() before calling filemap_fdatawrite().

    mm: vmscan: disable memcg direct reclaim stalling if cgroup writeback support is in use 
    Because writeback wasn't cgroup aware before, the usual dirty
    throttling mechanism in balance_dirty_pages() didn't work for 
    processes under memcg limit.  The writeback path didn't know how much
    memory is available or how fast the dirty pages are being written out 
    for a given memcg and balance_dirty_pages() didn't have any measure of
    IO back pressure for the memcg.

    To work around the issue, memcg implemented an ad-hoc dirty throttling
    mechanism in the direct reclaim path by stalling on pages under
    writeback which are encountered during direct reclaim scan.  This is
    rather ugly and crude - none of the configurability, fairness, or
    bandwidth-proportional distribution of the normal path.
