+Kernel core (/proc/kcore) format
+CONFIG_KCORE_ELF
+  If you enabled support for /proc filesystem then the file /proc/kcore
+  will contain the kernel core image. This can be used in gdb:
+
+  $ cd /usr/src/linux ; gdb vmlinux /proc/kcore
+
+  Selecting ELF will make /proc/kcore appear in ELF core format as defined
+  by the Executable and Linking Format specification. Selecting A.OUT will
+  choose the old "a.out" format which may be necessary for some old versions
+  of binutils or on some architectures.
+
+  This is especially useful if you have compiled the kernel with "-g" option
+  to preserve debugging information. It is mainly used for examining kernel
+  data structures on the live kernel so if you don't understand what this
+  means or are not a kernel hacker, just leave it at its default value ELF.
