iTWire: Do you ever find yourself reading the source code to other open source operating system (kernels), e.g., NetBSD, to see how a particular feature is implemented? What I mean is, as an author do you have/make time to read code other than kernel code, either for amusement or education?

LT: I haven't ever really found it useful to read other people's code for ideas - source code is a singularly bad medium for transferring high-level concepts, since the whole point is to tell a really stupid computer exactly what to do, rather than explain it at any human level.

So no, I wouldn't read code to see how something is implemented. I'd read code to see why something doesn't _work_ - but then it wouldn't be another OS, it would be something like reading the source code of zlib when I wondered why git spent so much time in some particular library routine ;)

In general, I'd much rather read a book meant for humans than code meant for computers. It's how I started - I still remember Bach's "The Design of the Unix Operating System" fondly. That's how I learnt about how Unix worked. Not to mention Tanenbaum's "Operating Systems: Design and Implementation" book.

These days? No, I don't read OS books any more. I actually seldom read computer books at all.
