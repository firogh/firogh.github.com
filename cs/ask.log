1. What exactly does "high CPU load" mean and how does it quantitatively
compare to the normal state?

# condition
Is the "high CPU load" condition reproducible reliably with the PTF?

# confirm
If I have understood correctly the customer is going to maintain the patches
themselves in SLE15-SP2 and there is no work to do for us. Can you please
confirm? I'll close the bug as WONTFIX in this case.
