# list_empty_carefull

    Fix subtle bug in "finish_wait()", which can cause kernel stack
    corruption on SMP because of another CPU still accessing a waitqueue
    even after it was de-allocated.
    
    Use a careful version of the list emptiness check to make sure we
    don't de-allocate the stack frame before the waitqueue is all done.

* NOTE: using list_empty_careful() without synchronization
* can only be safe if the only activity that can happen
* to the list entry is list_del_init(). Eg. it cannot be used
* if another CPU could re-list_add() it. 
[finish_wait with list_empty_careful maybe fragile or buggy??](https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/3/11/143)
Actually, it's not careful, but it's just specific.

    udp: Use hlist_nulls in UDP RCU code

    This is a straightforward patch, using hlist_nulls infrastructure.
    RCUification already done on UDP two weeks ago.
    Using hlist_nulls permits us to avoid some memory barriers, both
    at lookup time and delete time.
    Patch is large because it adds new macros to include/net/sock.h.
    These macros will be used by TCP & DCCP in next patch.
