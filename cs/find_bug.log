# misuse unsigned

change gpio pin from unsigned to signed in acpi callback
    The signed error will be wrongly used as valid gpio offset

fib_trie: coding style: Use pointer after check    

As Alexander Duyck pointed out that:
struct tnode {
	...
	struct key_vector kv[1];
}
The kv[1] member of struct tnode is an arry that refernced by
a null pointer will not crash the system, like this:
struct tnode *p = NULL;
struct key_vector *kv = p->kv;
As such p->kv doesn't actually dereference anything, it is simply a
means for getting the offset to the array from the pointer p.

This patch make the code more regular to avoid making people feel
odd when they look at the code.

    ARM: pxa: ssp: remove unnessary free for devm_xxx
    
    A Coccinelle warning.
    It's not necessary to free memory allocated with devm_xxx
    and using these free functions maybe lead to a double free that
    will corrupt the resource subsys. So, I just remove them.
    
    By the way, I replace devm_request_mem_region and devm_ioremap with
    devm_ioremap_resource as Julia's suggestion.

    Warning like this:
    
    drivers/md/md.c: In function ‘update_array_info’:
    drivers/md/md.c:6394:26: warning: logical not is only applied
    to the left hand side of comparison [-Wlogical-not-parentheses]
          !mddev->persistent  != info->not_persistent||
    
    I fix it by enclosing !mddev->persistent with parentheses
    
    By the way, I also fixed a line over 80 charaters warning outputed
    by ./scripts/checkpatch.pl
