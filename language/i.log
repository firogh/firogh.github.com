* Tell me about yourself.
Well, I'm currently unemployed and learning Enlish and Linux kenrel at home. Before that, I worked at windriver as an on-site controactor from CIE-net. CIE-net is outsoucing compay. My job was providing technical support to Cisco XR team on Linux kernel and yocto. So, actually, I was also a contracor in Cisco too.  And while I really enjoyed the work that I did,  I’d love the chance to work as kernel engineer contributing to upstream community, which is why I’m so excited about this opportunity.
* What are your greatest professional strengths?
