# Work better

# Leetcode

# Kernel upstream
Goal: review patches, create fixes, get known
Raw: review patches, at least 1 hour per day 
Work backwards: Get up to speed with upstream

Build and analysis

# Analysis
direct reason
bug type and causal chains

# Work goals
Don't waste time on doing rabbish things.
## Response time
Take a first quick look at incident once it's accpeted.

reason for the bug.
What do you learn.
## Process workflow

# L3 official goals 
Deliver exceptional L3 Support (individual objective)
The main task and core responsibility of the L3 teams is to deliver exceptional Level 3 Support service to our internal and external customers.
## Ensure that all your L3 incidents are well coordinated: https://pes.suse.de/L3/Signs_of_well_coordinated_L3_incidents/ , which includes:
- Build PTF and TEST packages in standard way (e.g. kernel packages using git workflow)
- Keep Bugzilla and SolidGround metadata up-to-date and in line with the L3 incident state
- Ensure that course of action is clear in the bugzilla ticket
- Do not silently reassign L3 bugs, always provide explanation
- Take part in the engineering work whenever reasonable
## Take L3 incidents from the queue to support the team objective, which is:
- Ensure fast response times on L3 incidents:
- 50% incoming incidents are accepted within 1 business day
- 80% incoming incidents are accepted within 2 business days
- 95% incoming incidents are accepted within 3 business days
- Process P0 and P1 incident with a high priority:
- 100% of P0 and P1 incidents are accepted and acted upon within 1 business day
## Ensure PTFs/TEST packages are built in a timely manner:
- P0 and P1 incidents: PTF must be built within 1 business day after an applicable patch is made available
- P2 incidents: PTF must be built within 3 business days after an applicable patch is made available
## Ensure that your L3 incidents are not left inactive:
    - There must not be any open L3 incidents without visible activity for more than 2 calendar weeks. Exceptions are incidents waiting for customer who can only provide input/feedback at a date which is more than two weeks in the future.
## Take care of IM responsibilities (https://pes.suse.de/L3/incident_manager/) 
if you are on Incident Manager duty and escalate to your manager if any of the responsibilities or team objectives (including the response times SLAs) can not be met during your IM shift. 
## Handover
Allow for easy handover of your incidents before your planned absence by following the "Vacation checklist" https://pes.suse.de/L3/Vacation/
