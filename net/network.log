# MTU or Ethernet MTU
This limits the number of bytes of data to 1500(Ethernet II) and 1492(IEEE 802), respectively. This characteristic of the link layer is called the MTU, its maximum transmission unit.

tcp_mtu_probing()
If you are using Jumbo Frames, we recommend setting tcp_mtu_probing = 1 to help avoid the problem of MTU black holes. Setting it to 2 sometimes causes performance problems.
