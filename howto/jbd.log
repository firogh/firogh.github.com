# Causality
1. Filesystem blocks kept in dynamic memory for long period of time will lost after system crash or power down failure.
Leave the FS in an in consistent state.
2. The traditional way checked FS before being mounted and fix
3. The journaling way can avoid running time-consuming consistency checks on the whole filesystem by looking instead in a special disk area that contains
the most recent disk write operations named journal.

# Elementry inference
Effect
dramatically reduce the fschk time

# JBD
## Log record
## Atomic operation handle
1. Backup data in journal area 
2. after data is committed to the journal, the blocks are written in the filesystem.
3. after data is committed to the filesystem, copies in journal are discarded.
## Transactions
For reasons of efficiency, the JBD layer manages the journal by grouping the log
records that belong to several atomic operation handles into a single transaction.
