=========================================================Additive Transitions:
These show addition, introduction, similarity to other ideas, &c.
# Addition
indeed,	further,	as well (as this),	either (neither),	not only (this) but also (that) as well,
also,	moreover,	what is more,	as a matter of fact,	in all honesty, 
and,	furthermore,	in addition (to this),	besides (this),	to tell the truth,
or,	in fact,	actually,	to say nothing of,	 
too,	let alone,	much less	additionally,	 
nor,	alternatively,	on the other hand,	not to mention (this),	


# Introduction:

 such as,	 as,	 particularly,	 including,	 as an illustration,
 for example,	 like,	 in particular,	 for one thing,	 to illustrate
 for instance,	 especially,	 notably,	 by way of example,	 

# Reference:

 speaking about (this),	 considering (this),	 regarding (this),	 with/in regard to (this),
 as for (this),	 concerning (this),	the fact that
  on the subject of (this)

# Similarity:

 similarly,	 in the same way,	 by the same token,	  in a like manner,
 equally	likewise,

# Identification:

 that is (to say),	 namely,	 specifically,	 thus,

# Clarification:

that is (to say),	I mean,	(to) put (it) another way	in other words,

========================================== Adversative Transitions:
These transitions are used to signal conflict, contradiction concession, dismissal, &c.
# Conflict:

 but,	 by way of contrast,	 while,	 on the other hand,
 however,	 (and) yet,	 whereas,	though (final position),
 in contrast,	 when in fact,	 conversely,	 still


# Emphasis:

 even more,	 above all,	 indeed,	 more importantly,	 besides

# Concession:

 but even so,	 nevertheless,	 even though,	 on the other hand,	 admittedly,
 however,	 nonetheless,	 despite (this),	 notwithstanding (this),	 albeit
 (and) still,	 although,	 in spite of (this),	 regardless (of this),	 
 (and) yet,	 though,	 granted (this),	 be that as it may,


# Dismissal:

 either way,	 whichever happens,	 in either event,	 in any case,	 at any rate,
 in either case,	 whatever happens,	 all the same,	 in any event,	 

# Replacement:

 (or) at least,	 (or) rather,	 instead

=================================================== Causal Transitions:
These transitions signal cause/effect and reason/result, etc. . .
# Cause/Reason:

 for the (simple) reason that,	 being that,	 for,	 in view of (the fact),	inasmuch as,
 because (of the fact),	 seeing that,	 as,	 owing to (the fact),	 
 due to (the fact that),	 in that	 since,	 forasmuch as,	

# Condition:

 on (the) condition (that),	 granted (that),	 if,	 provided that,	 in case,
 in the event that,	 as/so long as,	 unless	 given that,	 
 granting (that),	 providing that,	 even if,	 only if,	


# Effect/Result:

 as a result (of this),	 consequently,	 hence,	 for this reason,	 thus,
 because (of this),	 in consequence,	 so that,	 accordingly	 
 as a consequence,	 so much (so) that,	 so,	 therefore,	

# Purpose:

 for the purpose of,	 in the hope that,	 for fear that,	 so that,
 with this intention,	 to the end that,	 in order to,	 lest
 with this in mind,	 in order that,	 so as to,	 so,


# Consequence:

 under those circumstances,	 then,	 in that case,	 if not,
 that being the case,	 if so,	 otherwise	


============================================= Sequential Transitions
These transitions are used to signal a chronological or logical sequence.
# Numerical:

in the (first, second, etc.) place,	initially,	to start with,	first of all	thirdly, (&c.)
to begin with,	at first,	for a start,	secondly,	

# Continuation:

subsequently,	previously,	eventually,	next,
before (this),	afterwards,	after (this),	then


# Conclusion:

to conclude (with)	as a final point,	eventually,	at last,
last but not least,	in the end,	finally,	lastly,


# Digression:

 to change the topic	 incidentally,	 by the way,

# Resumption:

 to get back to the point,	 to resume	 anyhow,	 anyway,	  at any rate,
 to return to the subject,	

#Summation:

as was previously stated,	so,	consequently,	in summary,	all in all,
to make a long story short,
thus,	as I have said,	to sum up,	overall,
as has been mentioned,	then,	to summarize,	to be brief,	briefly,
given these points,	in all,	on the whole,	therefore,	 
as has been noted,	hence,	in conclusion,	in a word,	 
to put it briefly,	in sum,	altogether,	in short,
