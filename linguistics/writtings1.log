Why is my English so rubbish? I lost in the mice droping.

I have been trying to figure out the root cause of this problem for two years since I decided to better my English.
Recently, I have to leave from my current job and find a new one. I am eager to go abroad, but I don't have confidence in my Enlish.

Seeing this as an opportunity, I started to weigh it thoroughly.

Actually, I am not trying to come with a idea on how to make English better, but to conslidate my philosophy.

I have put too much effort on learning English, but the return is so low. There must be something wrong in my philosophy.

I examined the method I used before to imporve my English. With Mr Chen's help, I noticed that lack of outputs of English shoud be the primary cause.

I am used to learnig English by listening and reading. But what's wrong with this method?

Even through I can read almost all the English writen material with little effort, I cannot speak very simple Enlgish sentences fluently and correctly.

Why do my philosophy or something else lead me here?

People cannot the things without a name. It's my answer.

I used my reasoning ability to conquer Kernel and English grammar and Rote memory to increase my English vocabulary.

But both of these two methods are ineffective to output.

After wrote some words of this post, I suddently recognize that human has another ablity to master knowledge between rote memory and reasoning.

It's something like mimic. Using this ablity to learn Enlish should be very easy. Why?

We don't have to make up the sentence by ourselves. It's faster and native.

Learning to master a complex thing should be joyful.
