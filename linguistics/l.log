three-syllable window
Spanish observes the limitation that stress
must go on one of the last three syllables of the word (the “trisyllabic window”),
and shows a strong tendency toward penultimate stress. English likewise has a
three-syllable window (violated only rarely in words like chesitancy), and various
other limitations discussed in §14.5.3.
