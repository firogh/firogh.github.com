# 中英词汇搭配form差异.
汉语用'有'表示owership, existence. 而英语是用have和There be.
买给你, 卖给你, 而英语是for, to.

# 句子级别的form差异.
汉语Topic-prominent language: discourse oriented 把情景, 作为语义表达的一部分.topic就是情景. 句号表示topic的结束.
英语subject-prominent languages: sentence oriented. 以句子为单位, 每个句子严谨地遵循SVO. 如, 我看到一只鸟, 羽毛很漂亮. 第二句要用it做主语.复合句,区分主从, 有重点. 所以没有because... so..., 都成了从句.不行. 
## 英语
1. 英语倾向显示, 完整的语义.
SVO, possessive
1.1 主词一致性
汉语在一个大主题, 小主题跳来跳去ok. 
英语, 没有这个大主题, 所以小主题跳来跳去, 使逻辑混乱. 几个句子, 主语一致性, 保证表述同一个语义主题.
1.2 形式主语
it
1.3 be动词
为了遵从SVO.
2. 重点
汉语head-final
英语head-initial
先果后因.
3. 有小到大
英语小到大
4. 主从句
beacuse so,although but 不能一起用.
main verb?
5. 先后有序
先从后住, 需要逗号.
形意相符, 主句表重点, 从句表次要.
6. 时间清楚
汉语通过情景和明确的时间词
英语依靠动词变化就可以判断时间.
现在:speech time每一次说话都有一个不同的'现在'
事实习惯式:I eat apple.
6.1 时貌: 时间的样貌. 
单纯发生: I ate breakfast at 7 am.
正在进行: I was eating breakfast at 7 am.
在参考点已完成: I have eaten breakfast (by now).
进行式: 说话者选择强调/描述'时间正在进行中'ongoing.
完成式: 将时间与一个'完成参考点'关联起来, 强调事件'在参考点之前'已经完成.参考点常是by now.
7 你知我知:
a/the
8 命辨真假:
any只能用在未发生的事.因为未发生, 参与者不确定, 可以是任何人or物.
9. 理清责任
汉语: 报纸送来了, 主题+阐述.
英语: 被动式.
10. 时空转换
in a boundary
on a surface
at a spot


 

# 从句时态
[一个句子中可以有多种时态吗](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/25284676)


# as 引导非限定定语从句
as引出非限定性定语从句时，代替整个主句，对其进行说明但通常用于像as we all know, as it is known, as is known to all, 
as it is, as is said above, as always mentioned above, as is usual, as is often the case, as is reported in the newspaper等句式中。
as在非限定性定语从句中作主语、表语或宾语，且引出的从句位置比较灵活，可位于句首或句末，也可置于主句中间。
通常均由逗号将其与主句隔开。as有“正如……， 就像……”之意。
如：As is known to the United States, Mark Twain is a great American writer.
美国人都知道，马克·吐温是一位伟大的美国作家。（as在从句中作主语）
He forgot to bring his pen with him, as was often the case.
他忘了带笔，这是常事。（as在从句中作主语）
He is absorbed in work, as he often was.
他正在全神贯注地工作，他过去经常这样。（as在从句中作表语）
As we all know, the earth is round.
众所周知，地球是圆的。（as在从句中作宾语）
The two brothers were satisfied with this decision，as was agreed beforehand.
两兄弟对此决定都满意，这项决定在事前都已得到他们的同意。(as在从句中作主语)
Taiwan is，as you know，an inseparable part of China.
你知道，台湾是中国不可分割的一部分。(as在从句中作宾语)
as it is known to all (as 做状语从句连词，是状语从句)
与 as is known to all (as做主语，是定语从句)
即：As is widely known, the moon is closer to the us than the sun.(定从)
As it is known to everyone, I thought you knew about it too.(状从) [1]

### sound good

I agree with Irma. Neither form is considered more formal, but "as practiced by" is much more common than the longer forms, I believe. And "as is practiced by" may be grammatically correct, but it sounds unnatural to me without the "it." I therefore think there are only two forms:

...as practiced by... (best)
...as it is practiced by... (OK)
