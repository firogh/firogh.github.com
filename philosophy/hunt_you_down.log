Hunt you down - how did a good hunter search information

The first principle of hunting is believing the information exists, not didn't exist.

# kernel 
git blame/show
x86_64 -> i386/x86
The term of the kernel feature (on the top of the source code file, kernel book, google)

Example:
arch_get_unmapped_area_topdown found in x86_64 
git blame/show -> message -> link ->exec shield-> i386 -> git balme i386 mmap -> found tile flexible-mmap on the top of file.
search google -> flexible-mmap-2.6.7-D5[1] and parisc: add flexible mmap memory layout support -> as described in http://lwn.net/Articles/91829
