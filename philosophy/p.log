# The unentitled political philosophy
The essence of this world is being.
Every human, animal, tree and etc are both beings.
Every being can affect other being. If one doesn't control himself or herself willingly, one will be beinged by other beings. 

Willpower: An idea is like a seed; once planted in a person's mind, it's growth is determined by how well it is nourished. Without lasting relevance it might wither and die or become ousted by other ideas that occupy a larger space in the mindspace of the host. Some ideas though, once planted, strike roots and grow from a captivating notion into a fundamental ideology that overshadows and influences every thought that blossoms in it's wake." -- Homo Ludens or: Kojima's Evolution of Mankind (Death Stranding), RagnarRox
