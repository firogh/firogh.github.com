<p>In my view, it’s so important that Software’s Primary Technical Imperative has to be managing complexity.<br />
&hellip; Dijkstra pointed out that no one’s skull is really big enough to contain a modern computer program (Dijkstra 1972 The Humble Programmer), which means that we as software developers shouldn’t try to cram whole programs into our skulls at once; we should try to organize our programs in such a way that we can safely focus on one part of it at a time. The goal is to minimize the amount of a program you have to think about at any one time. You might think of this as mental juggling—the more mental balls the program requires you to keep in the air at once, the more likely you’ll drop one of the balls, leading to a design or coding error.</p>

<p>休谟更是猛烈地攻击了传统理性主义，他在《人性论》中说：理性是感性(Firo: 非理性) 的奴隶，除了服务和服从感性之外，再也不能有任何其他的作用。他认为理性本身是不存在的，纯理性不足以产生任何行动和意志作用。一切理性推理都不过是一种感觉。不但在文学艺术中，就是在哲学和科学中，我们也得遵循我们的爱好和情趣。</p>

<p>Just as the largest library, badly arranged, is not so useful as a very moderate one that is well arranged, so the greatest amount of knowledge, if not elaborated by our own thoughts, is worth much less than a far smaller volume that has been abundantly and repeatedly thought over. The difference between the effect produced on the mind by thinking for oneself and that produced by reading is <strong>incredibly great</strong>; and thus it is for ever <strong>increasing the original disparity between minds</strong>, by virtue whereof we are driven to the one or to the other. Thus reading forces on the mind ideas that are as foreign and heterogeneous to the tendency and mood it has at the moment, as is the seal to the wax whereon it impresses its stamp. Thus the mind is totally compelled from without to think first of one thing and <strong>then of another, for which it has absolutely no inclination or disposition.</strong> &hellip; Therefore the <strong>mind is deprived of all its elasticity by much reading</strong> as is a spring when a weight is continually applied to it; This practice is the reason why <strong>erudition makes most men more stupid and simple than they are by nature and also deprives their literary careers of every success.</strong> - Schopenhauer Parerga and Paralipomena Vol.2 Chapter XXII<br />

<p>Schopenhauver on reading and books: When we read, another person thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process.<br />
Schopenhauver on reading and books: From all this it may be concluded that thoughts put down on paper are nothing more than footprints in the sand: one sees the road the man has taken, but in order to know what he saw on the way, one requires his eyes.<br />

All by themselves my eyes put an end to all bookwormery, otherwise known as philology: I was released from the ‘book’, and read nothing more for years—the greatest favour I have ever done myself!That nethermost self, as if buried alive, as if made mute beneath the constant need to pay heed to other selves (—which is what reading is!) awoke slowly, shyly, hesitantly—but finally it spoke again. I have never been so happy with myself as in my life’s periods of greatest illness and pain: you need only take a look at Daybreak(Firo: also the dawn of day) or The Wanderer and His Shadow to understand what this ‘return to myself ’ was: the highest kind of recuperation!&hellip; The other kind simply followed on from this. &ndash; Ecce Homo Nietzsche, Why I write such good books, Review of Human, All Too Human section 4.(Firo: search bookwormery)<br />

<p>“I tend to approach things from a physics framework,” Musk said in an interview. “Physics teaches you to reason from first principles rather than by analogy. So I said, okay, let’s look at the first principles. What is a rocket made of? Aerospace-grade aluminum alloys, plus some titanium, copper, and carbon fiber. Then I asked, what is the value of those materials on the commodity market? It turned out that the materials cost of a rocket was around two percent of the typical price.” - Elon Musk<br />
