<h3 id="code-complete-2">Code complete 2</h3>

<p>In my view, it’s so important that Software’s Primary Technical Imperative has to be managing complexity.<br />
&hellip; Dijkstra pointed out that no one’s skull is really big enough to contain a modern computer program (Dijkstra 1972 The Humble Programmer), which means that we as software developers shouldn’t try to cram whole programs into our skulls at once; we should try to organize our programs in such a way that we can safely focus on one part of it at a time. The goal is to minimize the amount of a program you have to think about at any one time. You might think of this as mental juggling—the more mental balls the program requires you to keep in the air at once, the more likely you’ll drop one of the balls, leading to a design or coding error.</p>

<p>Just as the largest library, badly arranged, is not so useful as a very moderate one that is well arranged, so the greatest amount of knowledge, if not elaborated by our own thoughts, is worth much less than a far smaller volume that has been abundantly and repeatedly thought over. The difference between the effect produced on the mind by thinking for oneself and that produced by reading is <strong>incredibly great</strong>; and thus it is for ever <strong>increasing the original disparity between minds</strong>, by virtue whereof we are driven to the one or to the other. Thus reading forces on the mind ideas that are as foreign and heterogeneous to the tendency and mood it has at the moment, as is the seal to the wax whereon it impresses its stamp. Thus the mind is totally compelled from without to think first of one thing and <strong>then of another, for which it has absolutely no inclination or disposition.</strong> &hellip; Therefore the <strong>mind is deprived of all its elasticity by much reading</strong> as is a spring when a weight is continually applied to it; This practice is the reason why <strong>erudition makes most men more stupid and simple than they are by nature and also deprives their literary careers of every success.</strong> - Schopenhauer Parerga and Paralipomena Vol.2 Chapter XXII<br />

<h2 id="海边度假问题">海边度假问题</h2>

<p>why did I not start kernel programming? I think I am not competent to do kernel programming.<br />
So I start reading kernel source code to understand what others do. # This is OK. I don&rsquo;t know &lsquo;computing&rsquo; problem. My life experience and aweakenings and intelligence is limitted. And I was trying to make up the whole computer science from Turing Machine.<br />
Where am I wrong? I didn&rsquo;t think over computer science or kernel thoroughly from first principle or raw.<br />
How to make reading kernel source code equivalent to kernel programming?<br />
If don&rsquo;t consider problems, we can create whole things when we are reading kernel codes.<br />
So the fundamental difference between kernel programming and reading kernel codes is problems - we don&rsquo;t have/know the problems. Second difference is the amount of degree of creating.</p>

I love those who can smile in trouble, who can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection. &lsquo;Tis the business of little minds to shrink, but they whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves their conduct, will pursue their principles unto death. -Leonardo da Vinci<br />

<p>记少不记多,反而记更多; 时间是否充裕,都先记少. So I saw the less is more in action: the more studies, the less obvious elementary but fundamental things become; activity, on the other hand, strips things to their simplest possible model. &ndash; Antifragile, Nassim.

<p>“I tend to approach things from a physics framework,” Musk said in an interview. “Physics teaches you to reason from first principles rather than by analogy. So I said, okay, let’s look at the first principles. What is a rocket made of? Aerospace-grade aluminum alloys, plus some titanium, copper, and carbon fiber. Then I asked, what is the value of those materials on the commodity market? It turned out that the materials cost of a rocket was around two percent of the typical price.” - Elon Musk</p>

<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:Leonardo_da_Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>: I have been impressed with the urgency of doing. Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Being willing is not enough; we must do.<br />
Aristotle, The Nicomachean Ethics: For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.<br />

Montaigne: We take other men’s knowledge and opinions upon trust; which is an idle and superficial learning. We must make them our own. We are just like a man who, needing fire, went to a neighbor’s house to fetch it, and finding a very good one there, sat down to warm himself without remembering to carry any back home. What good does it do us to have our belly full of meat if it is not digested, if it is not transformed into us, if it does not nourish and support us?<br />

<p><a href="http://www.norvig.com/21-days.html">The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability</a><br />
Thomas Sterner, The Practicing Mind: When we practice something, we are involved in the deliberate repetition of a process with the intention of reaching a specific goal. The words deliberate and intention are key here because they define the difference between actively practicing something and passively learning it.</p>

<p>Schopenhauver on reading and books: When we read, another person thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process.<br />
Schopenhauver on reading and books: From all this it may be concluded that thoughts put down on paper are nothing more than footprints in the sand: one sees the road the man has taken, but in order to know what he saw on the way, one requires his eyes.<br />
Schopenhauer: “记录在纸上的思想，不过是像在沙上行走者的足迹而已，我们也许能看到他所走过的路径；如果我们想要知道他在路上看见些什么，则必须用我们的眼睛”<br />
Wang Yin: 观看阅读别人创造的现成的内容, 能让人短暂的知道哪些东西是怎么实现的, 却不能让你获得创造那样内容的能力. 即便是看似最简单基础的内容都无法理清.<br />
All by themselves my eyes put an end to all bookwormery, otherwise known as philology: I was released from the ‘book’, and read nothing more for years—the greatest favour I have ever done myself!That nethermost self, as if buried alive, as if made mute beneath the constant need to pay heed to other selves (—which is what reading is!) awoke slowly, shyly, hesitantly—but finally it spoke again. I have never been so happy with myself as in my life’s periods of greatest illness and pain: you need only take a look at Daybreak(Firo: also the dawn of day) or The Wanderer and His Shadow to understand what this ‘return to myself ’ was: the highest kind of recuperation!&hellip; The other kind simply followed on from this. &ndash; Ecce Homo Nietzsche, Why I write such good books, Review of Human, All Too Human section 4.(Firo: search bookwormery)<br />
